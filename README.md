Package mhsig provides functions for computing and comparing MinHash
signatures for bulk (as opposed to streaming) data.  For
probabilistic data structures that process streaming data
confer https:// github.com/dgrisky/go-minhash and
https://github.com/tylertreat/BoomFilters. The former package inspires
many of the implementation details of the present one.

MinHash signatures can be used to estimate the Jaccard index
J(A, B) := |A & B| / |A || B| of two sets that are subsets
of some finite, totally ordered set U.  If s is a permutation
of U chosen uniformly at random, then x := argmin s(A || B) is
just a random element chosen uniformly from A || B.  It's
clear that P(x in A & B) = J(A, B).  Since min s(A) = min s(B)
if and only if x is in A & B, we have just shown that
P(min s(A) = min S(B)) = J(A, B).

The central idea of minhash signatures is to repeatedly perform
the above experiment with different permutations as a way to estimate
the underlying probability
J(A, B) = P(an element x in A || B is also  in A & B).

A length k minhash signature S(A) is theoretically generated by randomly
choosing k permutations si (i=1, ..., k) in the symmetric group of U
(group of bijective endofunctions on U) and computing  hi(A) := min si(A)
for each permutation.  We take S(A) := [h1(A), ..., hk(A)].
Since each permutation is a bijection, min si(A) = min si(B) if and
only if argmin si(A) = argmin si(B) and so we could just as
well use these argmins, which is sometimes how the signature S(A) is
defined.

Specifying permutations for large U is not efficient, and so we often
take a family of integer-valued hash functions that are minwise
independent, in the sense that for most sets A,
min h(A) ! = min g(A) for two distinct hash functions in the family.
Frequently this family is parametrically  generated.
