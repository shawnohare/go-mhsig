Package mhsig provides functions for computing and comparing MinHash
signatures for bulk (as opposed to streaming) data.  For
probabilistic data structures that process streaming data
confer https:// github.com/dgryski/go-minhash and
https://github.com/tylertreat/BoomFilters. The former package inspires
many of the implementation details of the present one.

MinHash signatures can be used to estimate the Jaccard index
J(A, B) := |A & B| / |A || B| of two sets that are subsets
of some finite, totally ordered set U.  If s is a permutation
of U chosen uniformly at random, then x := argmin s(A || B) is
just a random element chosen uniformly from A || B.  It's
clear that P(x in A & B) = J(A, B).  Since min s(A) = min s(B)
if and only if x is in A & B, we have just shown that
P(min s(A) = min S(B)) = J(A, B).

The central idea of minhash signatures is to repeatedly perform
the above experiment with different permutations as a way to estimate
the underlying probability
J(A, B) = P(an element x in A || B is also  in A & B).

A length k minhash signature S(A) is theoretically generated by randomly
choosing k permutations si (i=1, ..., k) in the symmetric group of U
(group of bijective endofunctions on U) and computing  hi(A) := min si(A)
for each permutation.  We take S(A) := [h1(A), ..., hk(A)].
Since each permutation is a bijection, min si(A) = min si(B) if and
only if argmin si(A) = argmin si(B) and so we could just as
well use these argmins, which is sometimes how the signature S(A) is
defined.

Specifying permutations for large U is not efficient, and so we often
take a family of integer-valued hash functions that are minwise
independent, in the sense that for most sets A,
min h(A) ! = min g(A) for two distinct hash functions in the family.
Frequently this family is parametrically  generated.

### MinWise

The **MinWise** data structure computes the MinHash for a set by
creating a parametric family of hash functions.  It is initialized
with two hash functions and an integer size parameter.  The two hash
functions h1 and h2 generate the family h1 + k(h2).

#### Usage

Let's explore an example of ingesting a stream of data, sketching a signature,
and computing the similarity between signatures.

```go

package main

import (
  "log"

  "github.com/shawnohare/go-minhash"
  "github.com/dgryski/go-spooky"
  "github.com/dgryski/go-farm"
)

func main () {
  // Some pre-existing sets to compute the signatures of.
  S1 := []string{"123", "1", "2", "3", "4"}
  S2 := []string{34, 42, 2, 9001}
  words := []string{"idempotent", "condensation", "is", "good"}

  // Specify two hash functions to use with a MinWise instance.
  h1 := spooky.Hash64
  h2 := farm.Hash64
  size := 3

  // Init a new MinWise instance to handle the words set.
  wmw := minhash.NewMinWise(h1, h2, size)
  // Ingest the words set one element at a time.
  for _, w := range words {
    wmw.Push(w)
  }
  // Output the signature for the words set.
  wordsSig := wmw.Signature()

  // Repeat the above, but with string integer data S1 and integer data S2.
  mw1 := minhash.NewMinWise(h1, h2, size)
  mw2 := minhash.NewMinWise(h1, h2, size)
  // Ingest S1.
  for _, x := range S1 {
    mw1.PushStringInt(x) // Note the different push function.
  }
  // Ingest S2.
  for _, x := range S2 {
    mw2.Push(x) // we use Push for both integers and word strings.
  }

  // Comparing signatures.
  var s float64
  // Using a helper function that accepts MinHash interfaces.
  s = minhash.Similarity(mw1, mw2)
  // or if we wish, we can call the MinWise method directly.
  // s = mw1.Similarity(mw2)
  
  // Output signatures for potential storage.  Both are of type []uint64.
  sig1 := mw1.Signature()
  sig2 := mw2.Signature()
  
  // Suppose we store the sig1 and sig2 above and retrieve them as []int.
  // We can directly compare the similarities as follows.
  // First, convert to []uint64
  for i, v := range sig1 {
    sig1[i] = uint64(v)
    sig2[i] = uint64(sig2[i])
  }
  // Calculate similarities using the now  appropriately typed signatures.
  simFromSigs := minhash.MinWiseSimilarity(sig1, sig2).

  // If we want to continue to stream elements into the set represented by
  // sig1, we can convert it into a MinWise instance via
  m := NewMinWiseFromSignature(h1, h2,  sig1)
  // We can now stream in more elements an update the signature.
  m.Push(13)
}
```
